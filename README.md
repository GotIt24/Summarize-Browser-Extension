Browser Extension for using AI to summarize Websites

This Browser Extension is for Chrome

I intended this Browser Extension to work with ollama GPT API but you would have to install it with npm which doesn't work with a browser extension.
You will have to use your own API Link and API Key (enter both in popup.js) and then go to the options page of the browser extension to setup how you want to use the browser extension.

contentScript.js and background.js aren't used.
